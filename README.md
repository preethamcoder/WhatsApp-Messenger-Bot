# WhatsApp-Messenger-Bot
A bot to message/spam a certain contact/group on WhatsApp. Need to add the feature to enable users to send the message to himself/herself.

# THIS ONLY WORKS ON GOOGLE CHROME. IF YOU WANT TO USE IT, INSTALL THE LATEST CHROME-DRIVER and PUT IN YOUR CUSTOM 'PATH.'

# Why?
I just thought it would be cool to be able to replicate run-mail-bait, but on WhatsApp. Pretty decent performance, I reckon.

# How does this work?
The user will run the script, and then enter the name of the contact on WhatsApp. Then, he/she will be prompted to enter the message. A selection will follow, where the user can choose to message or spam the given contact. Enter the number of messages and the same message will be sent n times.

# Usage:
Install everything in the requirements.txt file.
Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/preethampython101/WhatsApp-Messenger-Bot.git
Modify the path to your local one.
Run the file with either of the commands below!
python3 whatsappbot.py or python whatsappbot.py

# Issues?
Feel free to mention them!
